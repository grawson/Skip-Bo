******************************************SKIP-BO**************************************************

This program is text-based version of the card game Skip-Bo; the rules are a bit similar to
solitare. The game can be played with human and/or computer players, and the user can decide
on the stockpile size from the beginning. The game also has a save/load feature, and a whole
bunch of colorful text!

The whole project was done with three other team members.

List of classes:

Table
    - holds the four decks in the middle of the "table" that are visible to all players
    - displays the table to each player, and moves cards out of play when necessary
Player
    - a super class that holds methods for playing cards and refilling the hand
Human
    - a subclass of player that handles input and output for the user
dumbAI
    - a subclass of player that handles computer decisions.
Hand
    - holds the hand of each player, has methods that tell if the hand is full, remove cards from the hand, adds cards, and checks whether a particular card is in the hand.
Buildpile
    - contains the stockpile of each player and relevant methods regarding its use.
Deck
    - a generic class that is used as a container in other classes, but also takes care of shuffling and reshuffling the set of playable cards as the game goes on.
Game
    - class that contains methods to run the full game, as well as save and load games. The main workhorse of our program.

Skip-Bo Driver
    - runs methods in Game and gets user input for start of game options.

Use:
	make test
		- compiles tests
	make
		- compiles Skip-Bo executable

    ./Skip-Bo
        - runs the program after it is compiled
